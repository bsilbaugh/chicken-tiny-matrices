Description
===========

Tiny Matrices provides a "reasonably" efficient implementation of matrix
algebra in 3 dimensions. Matrices are implemented using nonuples (see
Tuples package).

Status
======

Tiny Matrices should be usable for day-to-day work. However, breaking
changes to the language/API may occur without notice. Futhermore, there may
still be some lingering "bugs".

Installation
============

Tiny Matrices is packaged as a Chicken Scheme Egg. Installation of Tiny
Matrices should be a simple matter of downloading the source tree, and
running the chicken-install program.

Note that Tiny Matrices has the following dependencies, which you may need
to download and install manually before installing Tiny Matrices:
